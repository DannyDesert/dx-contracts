Dutch X contracts is a collection of smart contracts for a decentraized exchange 
that uses the dutch auction principle to provide a fare mechanism to exchange 
any ERC20 token pair.

It is a fully decentralized, featuring a price mechanism that starts with a 
high price which falls monotonically.

Eventually, every successful buyer pays the same price once the auction closes, 
ensuring orders donâ€™t have to be cancelled when markets fluctuate. 

While this mechanism eliminates the bottlenecks of decentralized order book 
exchanges, such as front-running and scaling difficulties, it also allows for a 
more streamlined trading experience.

# Security of the contracts
Security is one of the main focus for the Dutch X, so the code was subjected 
to several reviews, audits and bug bunties.

## Audit
The contracts were subjected thorough audit, the report can be finded in:
* [Audit Report inc. known weaknesses](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15aH3edp5IvkMS5R5pjzjg7wj08Vqh9OV/view)

## Bug bunty
Read Gnosis blog post:
* [Gnosis DutchX and Initial OWL Generation Bug Bounty](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-dutchx-and-initial-owl-generation-bug-bounty-71ba53dfd2db)

# Get started - Use DX in your project
Just add it to your project:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
yarn add truffle-contract @gnosis.pm/dx-contracts --save # or npm install @gnosis.pm/dx-contracts --save
```

You will find the compiled truffle contracts in the `build/contracts` folder,
these contract abstractions will also contain the addresses for the DX for 
**mainnet** and the **testnets**.

For example:
```js
const contract = require('truffle-contract')

// Create the truffle contracts
const Proxy = contract(require('@gnosis.pm/dx-contracts/build/contracts/Proxy'))
const DutchExchange = contract(require('@gnosis.pm/dx-contracts/build/contracts/DutchExchange'))

// Setup your provider
// provider = ...
DutchExchange.setProvider(provider)
Proxy.setProvider(provider)

// Get the contract instance
Proxy.deployed(async proxy => {
  const dx = DutchExchange.at(proxy.address)

  // Use any of the dx methods
  const token1 = '0x123456'
  const token1 = '0x654321'
  const auctionIndex = await dx.getAuctionIndex.call(token1, token2)
  console.log(auctionIndex)
})
```

# Development
## Setup and show the networks
The easiest way to 
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Compile and restore the network addresses
yarn restore

# Show current network addresses
yarn networks
```

## Execute migrations into a local ganache-cli
```bash
# Run ganache CLU
yarn rpc

# Execute the migrations for the dependencies
yarn migrate-dep

# Execute the migrations
yarn migrate

# Or you can do all at once using
yarn migrate-all
```

## Set the Ether price and Feed expire date for development
Some migrations allow you to specify some parameter so you can change some values
at deploy time:
* `ETH_USD_PRICE`: Allows to set the price of the ETH-USD oracle feed. Just for 
  local ganache-cli. It's `500 USD/ETH` by default.
* `FEED_EXPIRE_PERIOD_DAYS`: Allows to set the expiration date for the feed. 
  It's `365 days` by default

## Run all tests 
```bash
yarn test -s
```
The flag -s runs the tests in a silence mode. Additionally the flag -g can be added to plot the gas costs per test.


## Generate a new version
```bash
# In a release branch (i.e. release/vX.Y.X)
# Migrate the version to the testnets, at least rinkeby, and posibly mainnet
# You can optionally change the gas price using the GAS_PRICE env variable
yarn restore
MNEMONIC=$MNEMONIC_OWL yarn migrate --network rinkeby

# Extract the network file
yarn networks-extract

# Verify the contract in Etherscan
# Folow the steps in "Verify contract"

# Commit the network file
git add network.json
git commit -m 'Update the networks file'

# Generate version using Semantic Version: https://semver.org/
# For example, for a minor version
npm version minor
git push
git push --tags

# Deploy npm package
npm publish --access=public

# Merge tag into develop, to deploy it to production, also merge it into master
git checkout develop
git merge vX.Y.X
```

## Verify contract on Etherscan
Flatten the smart contract:
```bash
npx truffle-flattener contracts/TokenOWL.sol > build/TokenOWL-EtherScan.sol
npx truffle-flattener contracts/TokenOWLProxy.sol > build/TokenOWLProxy-EtherScan.sol
npx truffle-flattener contracts/OWLAirdrop.sol > build/OWLAirdrop-EtherScan.sol
```

Go to Etherscan validation page:
* Go to[https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/verifyContract?a=]()
* Fill the information:
  * Use `build/TokenOWL-EtherScan.sol`
  * Set the exact compiler version used for the compilation i.e. `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`
  * Optimization: `No`
* Press validate
